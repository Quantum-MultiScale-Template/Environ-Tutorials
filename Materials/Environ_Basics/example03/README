This example shows how to use pw.x to simulate isolated charged systems in 
vacuum or immersed in a continuum dielectric solvent. 

Two calculations, one in vacuum and one in a continuum dielectric with the 
dielectric permittivity of water, are performed on a pyridine cation, using 
two different periodic-boundary correction schemes, for a total of four
calculations. 

To keep the calculations simple, only the electrostatic interaction with the 
solvent is introduced in the calculation, via the Self-consistent continuum 
solvation (SCCS) model of O. Andreussi, I. Dabo and N. Marzari, J. Chem. Phys.
136 064102 (2012). 

The periodic-boundary correction schemes adopted are:

- martyna-tuckerman: self-consistent, reciprocal-space correction of the 
               electrostatic potential. REQUIRES A CELL AT LEAST TWICE AS BIG
	       AS THE SIZE OF THE SYSTEM UNDER STUDY. A part from the limitation
               on the cell size, this correction scheme gives perfect accuracy 
               at an almost negligible computational cost.
- pcc: self-consistent, real-space quadratic correction of the electrostatic 
               potentials, see I. Dabo et al. Phys. Rev. B 77, 115139 (2008). 
               REQUIRES A CUBIC CELL. The error vs system size scales as L^-5. 

Note that from ENVIRON version 1.0, the makov-payne correction scheme is 
no longer supported. 
 
The extension of the above approaches to simulations in a continuum dielectric
is described in details in O. Andreussi and N. Marzari, Phys. Rev. B 90 245101 (2014).
