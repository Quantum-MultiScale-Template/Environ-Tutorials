This example shows how to use pw.x to calculate the energy of a water 
cluster (thanks to Nicolas Hörmann for the structure) using a 
solvent-aware interface, as described in O. Andreussi, N.G. Hörmann, 
F. Nattino, G. Fisicaro, S. Goedecker, and N. Marzari, J. Chem. Theory 
Comput. 15, 1996 (2019).

This feature is particularly useful to model branched/open/porous 
systems, where pockets that are too small to fit a solvent molecule 
should remain dielectric-free. 

Two calculations are carried out. The first calculation includes
a standard interface between the quantum mechanical and the continuum
region, such that the dielectric unphysically fills the small pocket 
in between the  water molecules. The second calculation models instead a 
solvent-aware interface, which prevents the dielectric continuum to 
enter the central 'hole' of the cluster.

A rough explanation of the different solvent-aware related keywords 
is provided in the run_example.sh file.
