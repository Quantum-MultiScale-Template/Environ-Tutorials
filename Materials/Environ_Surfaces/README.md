# Environ Examples

    Example QE+Environ runs

example04: pw.x

    Use of parabolic correction for periodic boundary conditions in
    neutral and charged 2D systems (slab).

example05: pw.x

    Use of external classical charge distribution (planar) to model
    Helmholtz layer above a charged 2D system.

example06: pw.x

    Same as example05, but the electrolyte counter charge layer is
    modeled according to the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann model.
